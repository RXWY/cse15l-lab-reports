# Part 3
 Takeaways: I didn't know that UCSD has its own virtual machine with which I can upload files and interact. I also find the JUnit Tests very helpful in debugging - By entering the test case,  it can determine if there are any syntax errors and whether the code is functioning as expected. I also learned a lot about hosting servers, like how to create page paths and the mechanisms of search and add functions on websites.
