Instructions:

For each numbered step starting right after the timer (so steps 4-9),

Take a screenshot
Write down exactly which keys you pressed to get to that step, including <enter> and <space> (e.g., cd<space>L<tab><enter> or <down><down><down><down><down><down><down><enter>). For special characters like <enter> or <tab>, write them in angle brackets with code formatting.
Then, summarize the commands you ran and what the effect of those keypresses were.
For example, when you run the tests, you might want to use the up arrow or Ctrl-R to access your bash history rather than typing in the full command with classpath, etc. You might say something like this accompanying the screenshot for running the tests:

Keys pressed: <up><up><up><up><enter>, <up><up><up><up><enter> The javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java command was 4 up in the search history, so I used up arrow to access it. Then the java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ... command was 4 up in the history, so I accessed and ran it in the same way.

Add this lab report to your Github Pages site, and submit a PDF of it as usual.
