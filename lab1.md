> Comment: When cat was run w/o arguments, the terminal stops executing any other code.

> **Description**
* Example 1: When cd(change directory) without an argument, that means not changing to any directory or the same directory.
* Example 2: When ls(list) without an argument, it means to list items under the main/highest level of the directory.
* Example 3: When cat(concatenate) without an argument, it means concatenating 0 files, which the terminal awaits file input.

> **Description**
* As mentioned earlier, *"When ls(list) without an argument, it means to list items under the main/highest level of the directory."*
* When ls is used with a directory **(ls messages/)**, it outputs every file under that directory.
* When ls is used with a file name **(ls Hello.java)**, it returns the filename, indicating that there is only one file(itself) under that name.
